Only two of these clubs make the list, and they still don’t break into the top two.</p><p>The amount of trophies a club has doesn’t make them better another, but being the most successful club in Europe is a bragging right on its own.</p><p>In this post, we’ve looked at which club in Europe’s top divisions has the most trophies locked up in their museum.</p><h2><strong>5. SL Benfica (83 trophies)</strong></h2><p>The most successful team in Portugal, SL Benfica sit proudly in fifth place as one of the most successful teams in Europe. </p><p>Benfica have a record amount of Primeira Liga titles (37), a record amount of Taca de Portugal titles (26), a record amount of Taca da Liga titles (7), 8 Supertaca Candido de Oliveira, 3 Campeonato de Portugal and 2 European Cups.</p><h3><strong>Golden years</strong></h3><p>In the 1960s, Benfica went through its golden years by winning back-to-back European Cups in ‘61 and ‘62. Throughout the ‘60s Benfica reached three more European Cup finals, losing all three.</p><p>It was during these years that legendary Portuguese striker, Eusebio, played for Benfica scoring a remarkable 317 goals in 301 games. Eusebio is still the only player to win a Ballon d’Or while playing for a Portuguese club.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQNiNvhBZtk?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe><p><br></p><p>As well as glory in the European Cup, the 1960s saw Benfica win eight Premeria Liga titles and three <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%9322_Ta%C3%A7a_de_Portugal\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Taca de Portugal</a> cups.</p><p>In the ‘70s, Benfica continued to strive domestically, winning six Primeira Liga titles and two Taca de Portugal titles. In Europe, Benfica only managed to reach the semi-finals, beaten by Ajax and Johan Cruyff.</p><h3><strong>Back from the brink</strong></h3><p>After financial troubles in the ‘80s due to poor financial management, things didn’t get any easier for Benfica in the ‘90s. After decades of success, Benfica struggled domestically and in Europe- and entered a rare trophy.</p><p>It wasn’t until the 2003-04 season that Benfica would win their first trophy since the 1995-96 season. The season after this, Benfica won their first league title since 1994. More success would begin to follow from 2003-04, as Benfica looked to regain its dominance in Portgual.</p><h2><strong>4. Barcelona (87 trophies)</strong></h2><p>Competing with Spanish rivals Real Madrid, Barcelona is a dominant force in Spain and they have enjoyed spells of dominance in European competitions.</p><p>Barca has 26 La Liga titles, a record 31 Copa del Ray titles, a record 12 Supercopa de Espana titles, five European Cups/UEFA Champion Leagues, a record four UEFA Cup Winners’ Cups, a record five UEFA Super Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups.</p><h3><strong>Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona</strong></h3><p>Cruyff arrived from <a href=\"https://english.ajax.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Ajax</a> for a then-record fee of £920,000. In his first season, Cruyff helped Barca win their first league title for 14 years. The win included an impressive 5-0 victory away at Real Madrid.</p><p>After Cruyff departed, Barca looked to replace their star man with another star name. In 1982, they did just that by signing Maradona for a world record fee of £5 million. His time at Barca was short, but Maradona picked up a Copa del Ray and Spanish Super Cup medal.</p><p>Cruyff returned as manager in 1988, leading to a spell of dominance for the Spanish giants. </p><p>Players such as Hristo Stoichkov, Pep Guardiola, Eusebio, Ronald Koeman and Michael Laudrup were all part of Cruyff’s dream team era.</p><p>Cruyff saw Barca win 11 trophies under his management, including four consecutive La Liga titles.</p><h3><strong>Lionel Messi, Xavi and Iniesta</strong></h3><p>Former player Guardiola took over as manager in 2008 and brought with him his tika-taka style that would change the game completely.</p><p>Pep inherited a team full of stars such as Ronaldinho, Messi, Iniesta, Xavi and Carlos Puyol. Pep was quick to put his stamp on the team. Out went Ronaldinho and Deco, as Pep shaped his team around Messi, Xavi and Iniesta.</p><p>During Pep’s spell, they became the dominant team in Europe. During his four year spell at the club, Barca won 14 trophies including, two UEFA Champions Leagues and two FIFA Club World Cups.</p><h3><strong>Recent years</strong></h3><p>Barcelona has recently faced financial struggles which led to Messi reluctantly leaving the club after 21 years. On the field, Barca dropped into the Europa League for the first time in 17 years.</p><p>The former midfielder, Xavi, recently became the Barca manager in the hope to return.</p><h2><strong>3. Real Madrid (90 trophies)</strong></h2><p>Arguably one of the biggest clubs in <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/football\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">world football</a>, it is no surprise to see Real Madrid on this list.</p><p>Their trophy cabinet includes a record 35 La Liga’s, 19 Copa del Rey’s, 11 Supercopa de Espana’s, a record 13 European Cup/UEFA Champion Leagues, two UEFA Cup titles, four UEFA Super Cup titles, three Intercontinental Cups and four FIFA Club World Cups.</p><h3><strong>Early European success </strong></h3><p>After the creation of the European Cup (known now as the UEFA Champions League), Madrid cemented itself as the dominant force in European football.</p><p>They won five European Cups in a row between 1956 and 1960, leading to Madrid being awarded the original cup and the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/flB3oxPHvlU?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe><p><br></p><h3><strong>Galacticos</strong></h3><p>Madrid is known for having a team full of star names who have worn the famous white strip. The likes of Alfredo Di Stefano, Hugo Sanchez and Emilio Butragueno have all been blessed to play for Madrid but under new president Florentino Perez, Madrid entered another level.</p><p>Perez oversaw the signing of Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham, to name a few. The influx of players saw immediate success with a UEFA Champions League and Intercontinental Cup success in 2002, followed by a La Liga title in 2003.</p><p>Despite the immense talent in their squad, Madrid would go the next three seasons without winning a major title.</p><h3><strong>CR7 and La Decima</strong></h3><p>In 2009, Real Madrid broke the transfer record when they signed Cristiano Ronaldo for £80 million from Manchester United. Ronaldo helped Madrid reach a record 32nd La Liga title.</p><p>Real Madrid, aided by a front three of Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, finally reached La Decima in 2014. Their 10th Champions League trophy was made even sweeter by beating their local rivals Atletico Madrid in the final.</p><p>After finally reaching ten Champions League trophies, Madrid went on to win three Champions League in a row between 2014-2018. The 13 titles Madrid hold is the record for most Champions League titles.</p><h2><strong>2. Celtic (112 trophies)</strong></h2><p>One half of Glasgow and one half of the dominance in Scottish football, Celtic have found winning trophies in Scotland easy- and they also have past success in Europe under their belt.</p><p>Celtic boast 51 SPL titles, 40 Scottish Cup titles, 20 Scottish League Cup titles and one European Cup.</p><h3><strong>One night in Lisbon </strong></h3><p>Celtic had enjoyed years of domestic success, and in 1967, Celtic enjoyed success on the Continent. </p><p>Jock Stein led Celtic to glory in every competition they entered, but the most remarkable of these trophies was in Europe. Stein led the Glasgow team to glory against Inter Milan.</p><p>This win made them the first British side to win the European Cup.</p><p>The side that led Celtic to the glory that night became known as the “Lisbon Lions” and remain one of the best teams to wear the famous green and white hoops.</p><h3><strong>Modern-day</strong></h3><p>Success in Europe has been hard for Celtic to find, but success domestically has continued. Their last trip to a European final was in 2003 when they reached the UEFA Cup Final, losing 3-2 to Porto in extra time.</p><p>In Scottish football, Celtic saw a period of continued success when fierce rivals Rangers dropped down divisions due to financial issues.</p><p>The 2019-20 season saw Celtic complete a fourth consecutive domestic treble after a season hit by COVID-19 issues.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>1. Rangers (120 trophies)</strong></h2><p>The other side of Glasgow and the other side of the dominance in Scottish football take the top spot of the most successful club in Europe.</p><p>The Rangers’ impressive trophy cabinet boasts a record 55 SPL titles, three lower league titles, 33 Scottish Cups, 27 Scottish League Cups, one Scottish Challenge Cup and one European Cup Winners’ Cup.</p><h3><strong>European glory </strong></h3><p>Compared to their Glasgow rivals, Rangers have found success in Europe very difficult. Their only taste of European success came in 1972 when they beat Dynamo Moscow in the European Cup Winners’ Cup.</p><p>This success saw them slowly emerge from the shadow of a strong Celtic side led by Jock Stein. Rangers won their first title in 11 years during the 1974-75 season. This was quickly followed by a treble in the season after.</p><h3><strong>9-in-a-row</strong></h3><p>Rangers finally matched Celtic’s record of 9 titles in a row. Rangers won the league every season from 1988-89 to the 1996-97 season.</p><p>After the 9-in-a-row era team separated, Dick Advocaat became Rangers’ first foreign manager. He had an immediate impact after heavy investment, winning back-to-back titles.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFdeRKCy-2w?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe><p><br></p><h3><strong>Rise back to the top</strong></h3><p>In 2012, Rangers entered into liquidation and quickly reformed. The newly formed Rangers failed to stay in the SPL and joined the Scottish Football League. After discussions, Rangers were placed in the lowest division (The Third) rather than the First Division as they hoped for.</p><p>With a much-changed team, Rangers began the climb back to the top of the Scottish pyramid. One thing that didn’t change is the Rangers fan base, attracting crowds at 49,000 for fourth-tier games.</p><p>Rangers returned to the Scottish Premier League in the 2016-17 season.</p><h3><strong>Number 55</strong></h3><p>Rangers spent the first few years of their return to the top battling with Celtic, not able to break the Celtic hold on the SPL.</p><p>Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard soon took over the reins at Ibrox, and in 2021, Rangers won their first league title in 10 years.</p>', '2022-03-13', 1),

Maybe even their achievements outside of sport in wider society?&nbsp;</p><p>The awards they receive throughout their career certainly is a big part of their perceived success. Some athletes aren’t happy with just getting awards. They will strive to enhance the reputation of their sport, as well as being influences on society and the fight for equality.&nbsp;</p><p>The five athletes I’m about to discuss are the athletes I believe have been the most successful. I must also stress this is no particular order and I’m sure everyone will have their own opinion. </p><h2>Josh Stedman stokes the fires of the GOAT debate with his Top 5 most successful sportsmen and women. Are these the greatest athletes that ever lived?</h2><h2>Tiger Woods (<a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/tag/Golf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\">Golf</a>)</h2><p>A controversial start to the list but despite his rather public flaws, Tiger Woods dominated golf for a long period. Tiger was a sporting icon and is still an instantly recognisable face, even if it is not always for the right reasons.</p><h3><strong><em>Early Career</em></strong></h3><p>Woods’ talent was there from a young age. On TV show Good Morning America, Woods showed off his talent to the nation. Whilst at University, Woods won various amateur U.S. golf titles before turning pro in 1996. Golfing glory was soon to follow. Aged 21, Woods won the <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/famous-golf-courses-augusta-national\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">US Masters at Augusta</a> in 1997, with a record score of 270. Not only was he the youngest person to earn the title, but he was also the first African American. The following years saw Woods pick up four U.S. PGA titles, three U.S. Open wins, three Open Championship wins, and three U.S. Masters wins.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><em>Controversy&nbsp;</em></strong></h3><p>In 2009, Woods career came to a grinding halt due to marriage infidelity reaching the media. Woods denied all allegations at the start of the rumours but as more peoples name were announced and more evidence on show, Woods admitted the private life issues he was facing. Tiger stepped back from golf to focus on himself and his family.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite returning to golf in 2010, Woods continued to have issues on and off the green. A back injury which led to his fourth back operation and another break from golf. More personal issues arose for Woods. In 2017, Tiger had to receive professional help for managing taking medication and pleaded guilty to a reckless driving charge.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAd0DwZUyog/hqdefault.jpg\"></p><p>The story of Tiger Wood’s 2019 Master victory</p><h3><strong><em>Return to glory</em></strong></h3><p>In 2019, Woods struck again. After 11 years of ups and downs, mainly downs, Tiger won his fifth Masters title, completing a movie styled comeback. The then President, Donald Trump, awarded Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><p>Woods’ comeback from the low points he went through is inspirational to everyone suffering in life. This, coupled with his dominance of the golfing world before his hiatus makes Woods one of the greatest athletes of all time.</p><h2>Serena Williams (<a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/tag/Tennis\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\">Te</a><a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/tennis\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\">nn</a><a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/tag/Tennis\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\">is</a>)</h2><p>Serena Williams is the greatest female athlete of all time and is up there with the greatest athletes of all time. Williams has used her status in tennis to further the female tennis game and stand for equal rights for women in society.</p><h3><strong><em>On-Court</em></strong></h3><p>Serena has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, along with several Olympic gold medals and doubles titles. Her first title came in 1999 and, she would complete the grand slam in 2003. Williams had a hiatus from the sport due to injury. In 2008, she returned to winning ways and reclaimed her number 1 spot by 2009. Since then, she has dominated the female game.</p><p>Williams is known for her competitive nature and her champion attitude. Often Williams on-court behaviour has been questioned after outbursts that have led to fines and run-ins with the tennis authorities. This hasn\'t stopped Williams from pursuing equality for female tennis players.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZHqedOpPzk/hqdefault.jpg\"></p><h3><strong><em>Off-Court</em></strong></h3><p>Williams has always been vocal about the need for equality in not just tennis but in broader society. During Serena’s 2018 U.S. Open final she claimed that an umpire showed a different level of tolerance than a male player would receive. Williams was penalised for an outburst during the game and the WTA denied any sexism stating:</p><blockquote><strong><em>\"The WTA believes that there should be no difference in the standards of tolerance provided to the emotions expressed by men versus women.\"</em></strong></blockquote><p><br></p><p>The incidents sparked a debate in the sporting world, with people split over the comments by Serena. BBC tennis presenter Sue Barker said: </p><blockquote><strong><em>\"I\'ve sat courtside watching the men ranting at umpires and they haven\'t been given a violation.\"&nbsp;</em></strong></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Williams is one of the only female athletes to appear on the Forbes list of highest-paid athletes. Nike signed a deal with the tennis superstar in 2003 and she has been a lead athlete for Nike ever since. Other noticeable endorsements include Gatorade, Pepsi and Beats by Dre.</p><h2>Tom Brady (<a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/nfl\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\">NFL</a>)</h2><p>At the young age of 43, Brady recently secured his seventh Superbowl ring. The win now means he has more Superbowl wins than any franchise in the NFL. Brady has also now won a Superbowl in each of the past three decades. The crazy thing is, he doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon</p><h3><strong><em>Early Career</em></strong></h3><p>Brady was a sixth-round draft pick for <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/nfl-team-profile-the-new-england-patriots\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">the New England Patriots</a> in the 2000 draft. As a sixth-round draft, no one would have expected Brady to have the career he has had. Brady was able to break into the starting QB role in his second season due to an injury to Drew Bledsoe. Once he stepped into the starting spot, Brady never looked back and took control of the team. </p><p>In this first season, Brady helped the Patriots to a win in Super Bowl XXXVI against the St. Louis Rams, a game in which Brady won the MVP award. This Super Bowl win was the first of Brady’s seven rings.</p><p>In 2007, Brady was a leading force in the near-undefeated season but they lost to the New York Giants at Super Bowl XLII. The following season Brady picked up a knee injury. Many thought this may be the end of Brady, after several operations and rehabilitation that meant he missed the whole season. </p><p>Despite the injury, the Patriots stuck with their starman. Brady led the team to yet another Super Bowl in 2011. Though, the Giants were again there to stop a dream comeback from injury.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dhy2t2uEAXo/hqdefault.jpg\"></p><h3><strong>Ring Number 5</strong></h3><p>In 2016, he surpassed his QB idol, Joe Montana, for Super Bowl wins. Brady’s fifth Superbowl ring came with his fourth Super Bowl MVP but the season was remembered for off-pitch drama. The “Deflategate” came around after the 2014 season but reemerged in 2015. It was discovered Brady was aware of ball-tampering by the Patriots.&nbsp;</p><p>The records kept coming for Brady despite reaching the age of 40. In 2017, Brady threw an NFL-high 4,577 yards during a 13-3 season for the Patriots. Super Bowl LIII was the moment Brady became the record Super Bowl-winning player. A rare quiet came still saw Brady push New England to the win, and his sixth Super Bowl triumph.</p><h3><strong><em>Pastures New</em></strong></h3><p>Questions were beginning to be asked about Brady and whether he was at the end of his career. Brady announced in 2020, he would be leaving the Patriots and would be joining the <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/tampa-bay-buccaneers-nfl-team-profile\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>. </p><p><strong><em>Super Bowl 7 for Brady</em></strong></p><p>Under the guidance of Brady, Tampa Bay reached their first playoffs for 13 years. Tampa Bay went on to win the Super Bowl, and Brady claimed his seventh ring. <strong>He became only the fourth QB to win the Super Bowl with two different teams.</strong></p><p>It doesn’t look like Brady will be finished just yet either. Many see him as one the greatest ever in <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/nfl\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">the NFL</a>, and, he is an American icon. For all of this, he makes my list of greatest ever athletes.</p><p><a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/nfl-career-tom-brady-goat\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">What a career Tom Brady has had</a> (so far!).

During the six years at their youth clubs, Messi scored almost 500 goals - a sign of things to come. Messi joined Spanish giants, Barcelona, at 13-years-old. Barca famously paid for Messi’s growth hormone treatment, something that hampered a move to River Plate.&nbsp;</p><p>In October 2004 at 17-years-old, Messi made his competitive debut for Barcelona as a substitute. It is reported Messi was promoted to the first-team after several requests were made by other first-team players. </p><p>Just under a year later, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina against Hungary in a friendly. Messi was sent off within a few minutes after his introduction following a clash with a defender. Messi has gone on to captain Barca and Argentina, in a career that has seen record numbers of individual and team rewards.</p><p>Anyone that can remember the <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/sporting-history-the-2009-champions-league-final-manchester-united-vs-barcelona\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">2009 Champions League Final</a> will tell you about the star quality of Messi in that match.

This man has often been voted the greatest NBA player of all time and, to me, he is the greatest athlete of all time. Even before the release of the hit Netflix show, <em>The</em> <em>Last Dance, </em>people knew he was a pure athlete, the show just amplified that and showed us why <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/2020/4/17/iconic-sport-shots-michael-jordan-1988-dunk-contest\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Michael Jordan is the greatest.</a></p><h3><strong><em>Jordan’s Early Days</em></strong></h3><p>As a sophomore in college, Jordan was named the College Player of the Year by The Sporting News, an award he won as a junior. Once his junior year was up, the Chicago Bulls drafted Jordan as a third pick in the 1984 NBA draft. The Bulls decision paid off straight away. </p><p>Their season results improved to 11 more wins than the season prior. Jordan was named the <strong>NBA Rookie of the Year with an average 28 points-per-game, 6.5 rebounds-per-game and 5.9 assists-per-game</strong>.</p><p> The year after Jordan would make his NBA All-Star debut for the Eastern All-Star team. The game was overshadowed by controversy due to the apparent issues between Jordan and Isiah Thomas.</p><p>After establishing himself as a franchise player and seeing the roster around him improve, Jordan and the Bulls started aiming for the Championship. In 1991, the Bulls won their first NBA title, losing only two games during the season. </p><p>The following two seasons, the Bulls won the NBA with Jordan picking up the NBA finals MVP in all three title-winning seasons. After the three title wins, rumours of gambling issues came into the limelight. The rumours weren’t able to dampen the bright lights of his hero status.</p><p>Eager for a new challenge, Jordan moved to baseball, another sport he excelled in during his younger life. Jordan wasn’t able to make the MLB but instead played in the Class AA Southern League. Baseball was in a wage battle at the time leading Jordan to announce simply to the NBA world: “I’m Back.”</p><p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cuLprHh_BRg/hqdefault.jpg\"></p><h3><strong><em>Jordan - “I’m Back.”</em></strong></h3><p>Jordan returned to the Bulls, wearing number 45 rather than his famed 23. He would later return to number 23 after a steady return to the court. The Bulls at this time had Scottie Pippen and Denis Rodman to accompany Jordan. MJ was able to lead the Bulls to yet another three-peat from 1996-1998. The winning shot in the third title win with 6.6 seconds left in the game remains one the most iconic pictures in sporting history.</p><p>One final return to the sport with Washington Wizards in 2000 saw Jordan take ownership and be the team executive. Jordan returned to the court in 2001 on a two-year contract. After the short spell on the court, Jordan returned to his ownership role to watch youngsters like <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/kobe-bryant-the-10-greatest-players-in-nba-history\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Kobe Bryant</a> take his mantle.</p><h3><strong><em>Off-court&nbsp;</em></strong></h3><p>As soon as Jordan arrived in the NBA, Nike snapped up the chance to sign the highly-rated youngster to their brand. Jordan signed with Nike in 1984 and launched the <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/the-rise-of-air-jordan\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">now worldwide Air Jordan Brand</a>. Shoes were the main selling point at the start but, they have since ventured into basketball clothing, streetwear and even other sports. Nike Air Jordan is a brand that has spread across five decades and crosses the boundaries of different sports with ease.</p><p>Jordan commits big amounts of money to various charities and community programmes across America. Overall, Jordan has donated multi-millions since starting his career. His dedication to improving the lives of others has propelled him into a permanent superstar.</p><p>Probably the <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/20-greatest-nba-players-of-all-time-basketball\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">NBA’s Greatest ever player</a>, we will never see the likes of MJ again.</p><h2><strong><em>Wayne Gretzky (</em></strong><a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/tag/Ice%20Hockey\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>Ice Hockey</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong></h2><p>Many words have been used to describe Wayne Gretzky, every superlative possible. He is known simply as The Great One. Gretzky to many is the greatest hockey player of all time, his achievements and career show just why.</p><h3><strong><em>Gretzky’s Early Years</em></strong></h3><p>Gretzky learned to skate on a rink built by his father Walter, leading to his well-known quote <em>“it is not god-given, it is Wally-given,” </em>a nod to his father’s input in his early years. After spending years perfecting his game at a young age, Gretzky joined a team four years his senior at the age of 6-years old.</p><p>After impressing for many years as a teenager, it was during this time he started wearing the famed ‘99’ jersey that is synonymous with Gretzky’s name.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCrUcovi820/hqdefault.jpg\"></p><h3><strong><em>Pro Career</em></strong></h3><p>After a brief spell with the former WHA franchise Indianapolis Racers before they folded, Gretzky joined the Edmonton Oilers. It was here the NHL legend made his greatness known. During this time, Gretzky won four Stanley Cups and made a habit of scoring 400 goals per season, which set a precedent for NHL dominance.</p><p>Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in 1988 but wasn’t able to win another Stanley Cup in his career. Despite this Gretzky managed to surprise Gordie Howe’s all-time point and goal-scoring records in the NHL, cementing himself as the greatest to grace the ice.</p><h3><strong><em>Achievements&nbsp;</em></strong></h3><p>Gretzky holds various records in Hockey that look near impossible for anyone to break. <strong>When Gretzky retired in 1999, he held or shared 61 National Hockey League (NHL) records</strong>. This included 40 regular-season records, 15 playoff records and 6 All-Star records.</p><p>Arguably the achievement that showed Gretzky’s greatness the best was the decision by every franchise in the league to retire the 99 jerseys as a sign of respect.</p><h2><strong><em>Lewis Hamilton (</em></strong><a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/tag/Formula%201\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>F1</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong></h2><p>Many thought that racing drivers after the great Michael Schumacher would struggle to make a real impact on the sport but Lewis Hamilton has taken sporting achievement in F1 to another level. Although many people believe <a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/blog/jim-clark-was-he-the-best-driver-ever\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 110, 26); background-color: transparent;\">Jim Clark is the best driver ever</a>, Hamilton is certainly laying claim to that crown.</p><h3><strong><em>Struggle from early&nbsp;</em></strong></h3><p>F1 is a notoriously hard sport to break into. Even from younger years you need some money behind you to succeed and further your career. This can often hold people back and prevent talent from emerging. Hamilton, to his own admission, fell into this category but Lewis and his father, Anthony, battled their way through the youth ranks to reach F1.</p><p>Hamilton impressed throughout his youth career in karting and quickly became a racing prodigy. In 1998 after winning the Super Series and British Championship for a second time, McLaren signed Hamilton onto their development scheme. The contract included the option for Hamilton to eventually drive for McLaren in F1 when the time came.</p><h3><strong><em>New guy on the block</em></strong></h3><p>Lewis got his chance at the top level in 2007 for McLaren. In his debut season he showed his talents, breaking records throughout the season and ruffling a few feathers along the way. His teammate at the time was two-time champion, Fernando Alonso, who had various run-ins with Hamilton, leading to Alonso leaving at the end of Hamilton’s first season.</p><p>The young Brit astonished spectators and pundits in his first season and managed to mount a genuine title challenge in his first season. Hamilton also equalled the record for most wins in a debut season but this was just a sign of things to come.</p><h3><strong><em>First World Title and Mercedes Domination</em></strong></h3><p>In only his second season, Hamilton won his first World Championship and at the time became the youngest ever World Champion. After his first title, Hamilton struggled to win another title with McLaren as Red Bull emerged as the leading force in F1.</p><p>In the final few years, Hamilton\'s relationship with McLaren soured and for the 2013 season he joined Mercedes. In his second season with Mercedes, Hamilton won his second World Championship beating teammate Nico Rosberg. This is where his dominance in F1 began. Since 2014 Hamilton has been involved in a title battle each season, winning a further 5 World Championships and equalling Schumacher\'s record number of titles.&nbsp;</p><p>With Mercedes Hamilton looks set to break the record for most F1 World Championships. This record will sit nicely with his record amount of race wins, pole positions and most wins from pole position.</p><h2><strong><em>Roger Federer (</em></strong><a href=\"https://thesporting.blog/tennis\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>Tennis</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong></h2><p>Regarded by many as the greatest male tennis player of all time, the silky Swiss player has been ever-present in the game for almost 20 years. Apart from 2016-17 when Roger Federer was injured, he has been ranked in the top 10 since 2002.</p><p><strong><em>2003 - 2010 Dominance&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>These years were a prime time for Federer’s success, reaching 18 out of 19 possible Grand Slam finals between 2005-2010. This was something that was unseen before Roger and cemented him as a true legend of the game.</p><p>During these years, Federer won 6 Wimbledon trophies, including 5 in a row from 2003-2007. He excelled in other tournaments across the tennis calendar, winning double figure trophies in 2004, 2005 and 2006.</p><p><img src=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/mExHw1oTP8Y/hqdefault.jpg\"></p><h3><strong><em>Number 8 at Wimbledon&nbsp;</em></strong></h3><p>Despite his big rivalry with Rafael Nadal and now Novak Djokovic, Federer has created a legacy at Wimbledon with the amount of titles he has won. Federer set the record for number of Wimbledon titles in 2017 by winning his 8th championship.</p><p>Roger still manages to draw in the crowds at Wimbledon as fans still wish for a glimpse of the great man before his playing games come to an end.</p><h3><strong><em>Records</em></strong></h3><p>The highlight of Roger’s record list includes winning 20 Grand Slam singles titles and <strong>holding the world no.1 position for 310 weeks</strong>, which included 237 weeks consecutively.

Keeping that secure is vital to consumer trust, but so far the IoT\'s security track record has been extremely poor. Too many IoT devices give little thought to the basics of security, like encrypting data in transit and at rest.</p><p>Flaws in software -- even old and well-used code -- are discovered on a regular basis, but many IoT devices lack the capability to be patched, which means they are permanently at risk.

It expects devices to have unique passwords, that companies will provide a public point of contact so anyone can report a vulnerability (and that these will be acted on), and that manufacturers will explicitly state how long devices will get security updates. It\'s a modest list, but a start.&nbsp;</p><p>When the cost of making smart objects becomes negligible, these problems will only become more widespread and intractable.</p><p>All of this applies in business as well, but the stakes are even higher. Connecting industrial machinery to IoT networks increases the potential risk of hackers discovering and attacking these devices. Industrial espionage or a destructive attack on critical infrastructure are both potential risks. That means businesses will need to make sure that these networks are isolated and protected, with data encryption with security of sensors, gateways and other components a necessity. The current state of IoT technology makes that harder to ensure, however, as does a lack of consistent IoT security planning across organisations.

Take the smart home: it can tell when you wake up (when the smart coffee machine is activated) and how well you brush your teeth (thanks to your smart toothbrush), what radio station you listen to (thanks to your smart speaker), what type of food you eat (thanks to your smart oven or fridge), what your children think (thanks to their smart toys), and who visits you and passes by your house (thanks to your smart doorbell). While companies will make money from selling you the smart object in the first place, their IoT business model probably involves selling at least some of that data, too.</p><p>What happens to that data is a vitally important privacy matter. Not all smart home companies build their business model around harvesting and selling your data, but some do.</p><p>And it\'s worth remembering that IoT data can be combined with other bits of data to create a surprisingly detailed picture of you. It\'s surprisingly easy to find out a lot about a person from a few different sensor readings.

Just what those sensors are collecting will depend on the individual device and its task. Sensors inside industrial machinery might measure temperature or pressure; a security camera might have a proximity sensor along with sound and video, while your home weather station will probably be packing a humidity sensor. All this sensor data – and much, much more – will have to be sent somewhere. That means IoT devices will need to transmit data and will do it via Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G and more.</p><p>Tech analyst IDC calculates that within five years IoT gadgets will be creating 79.4 zettabytes of data. Some of this IoT data will be \"small and bursty\" says IDC – a quick update like a temperature reading from a sensor or a reading from a smart meter. Other devices might create huge amounts of data traffic, like a video surveillance camera using computer vision.</p><p>IDC said the amount of data created by IoT devices will grow rapidly in the next few years. Most of the data is being generated by video surveillance, it said, but other industrial and medical uses will generate more data over time.</p><p>It said drones will also be a big driver of data creation using cameras. Looking further out, self-driving cars will also generate vast amounts of rich sensor data including audio and video, as well as more specialised automotive sensor data.</p><p>Internet of Things and big data analytics</p><p>The IoT generates vast amounts of data: from sensors attached to machine parts or environment sensors, or the words we shout at our smart speakers. That means the IoT is a significant driver of big-data analytics projects because it allows companies to create vast data sets and analyse them. Giving a manufacturer vast amounts of data about how its components behave in real-world situations can help them to make improvements much more rapidly, while data culled from sensors around a city could help planners make traffic flow more efficiently.</p><p>That data will come in many different forms – voice requests, video, temperature or other sensor readings, all of which can be mined for insight. As analyst IDC notes,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45213219\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 116, 199);\">IoT metadata category</a>&nbsp;is a growing source of data to be managed and leveraged. \"Metadata is a prime candidate to be fed into NoSQL databases like MongoDB to bring structure to unstructured content or fed into cognitive systems to bring new levels of understanding, intelligence, and order to outwardly random environments,\" it said.</p><p>In particular, the IoT will deliver large amounts of real-time data.

As a result, smart cities projects are a key feature of the IoT. Cities already generate large amounts of data (from security cameras and environmental sensors) and already contain big infrastructure networks (like those controlling traffic lights). IoT projects aim to connect these up, and then add further intelligence into the system.</p><p>There are plans to blanket Spain\'s Balearic Islands with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-do-you-turn-these-islands-into-a-living-iot-lab-just-add-500000-sensors/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 116, 199);\">half a million sensors</a>&nbsp;and turn it into a lab for IoT projects, for example.

(5, 5, 1, 'MongoDB vs MySQL Differences', '<h2>What are the main differences between MongoDB and MySQL?</h2><h4>MySQL</h4><p>MySQL is a popular, free-to-use, and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle. As with other relational systems, MySQL stores data using tables and rows, enforces referential integrity and uses structured query language (SQL) for data access. When users need to retrieve data from a MySQL database, they must construct an SQL query that joins multiple tables together to create the view on the data they require.</p><p>Database schemas and data models need to be defined ahead of time, and data must match this schema to be stored in the database. This rigid approach to storing data offers some degree of safety, but trades this for flexibility. If a new type or format of data needs to be stored in the database, schema migration must occur, which can become complex and expensive as the size of the database grows.</p><h4>MongoDB</h4><p>MongoDB is also free to use and open source; however, its design principles differ from traditional relational systems. Often styled as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/compare/https//www.mongodb.com/non-relational-database\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">non-relational</a>&nbsp;(or NoSQL) system, MongoDB adopts a significantly different approach to storing data, representing information as a series of JSON-like documents (actually stored as binary JSON, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">BSON</a>), as opposed to the table and row format of relational systems.</p><p>MongoDB documents consist of a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/key-value-database\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">key/value</a>&nbsp;pairs of varying types, including arrays and nested documents; however, the key difference is that the structure of the key/value pairs in a given collection can vary from document to document. This more flexible approach is possible because documents are self-describing.</p><h2>When to Use MongoDB vs MySQL</h2><p>The core differences between these two database systems are significant. Choosing which one to use is really a question of approach rather than purely a technical decision.</p><p>MySQL&nbsp;is a mature relational database system, offering a familiar database environment for experienced IT professionals.</p><p>MongoDB&nbsp;is a well-established, non-relational database system offering improved flexibility and horizontal scalability, but at the cost of some safety features of relational databases, such as referential integrity.</p><p>Which one should you choose?</p><p>In the following sections, we’re going to look at some of the different considerations when deciding between MongoDB and MySQL.</p><h2>MongoDB vs MySQL User-Friendliness</h2><p>MongoDB is an attractive option to developers. Its data storage philosophy is simple and immediately understandable to anybody with programming experience.</p><p>MongoDB stores data in collections with no enforced schema. This flexible approach to storing data makes it particularly suitable for developers who may not be database experts, yet want to use a database to support the development of their applications.</p><p>Compared to MySQL, this flexibility is a significant advantage: To get the best out of a relational database, you must first understand the principles of normalization, referential integrity, and relational database design.</p><p>With the ability to store documents of varying schemas, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/unstructured-data\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">unstructured data</a>&nbsp;sets, MongoDB provides a flexible developer interface for teams that are building applications that don’t need all of the safety features offered by relational systems. A common example of such an application is a web application that doesn\'t depend on structured schemas; it can easily serve unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data, all from the same MongoDB collection.</p><p>MySQL is a common choice for users who have extensive experience using traditional SQL scripting, designing solutions for relational databases, or who are modifying or updating existing applications that already work with a relational system. Relational databases may also be a better choice for applications that require very complex but rigid data structures and database schemas across a large number of tables.</p><p>A common example of such a system could be a banking application that requires very strong referential integrity and transactional guarantees to be enforced to maintain exact point-in-time integrity of data.</p><p>However, it is important to clarify that MongoDB also supports ACID properties of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/basics/transactions\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">transactions</a>&nbsp;(atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability). This enables greater flexibility in building a transactional data model that can horizontally scale in a distributed environment and has no impact on performance for multi-document transactions.</p><h2>MongoDB vs MySQL Scalability</h2><p>A key benefit of the MongoDB design is that the database is extremely easy to scale. Configuring a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-components/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">sharded cluster</a>&nbsp;allows a portion of the database, called a shard, to also be configured as a replica set. In a sharded cluster, data is distributed across many servers. This highly flexible approach allows MongoDB to horizontally scale both read and write performance to cater to applications of any scale.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/replication/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">replica set</a>&nbsp;is the replication of a group of MongoDB servers that hold the same data, ensuring high availability and disaster recovery.</p><p>With a MySQL database system, options for scalability are much more limited. Typically, you have two choices: vertical scalability, or adding read replicas. Scaling vertically involves adding more resources to the existing database server, but this has an inherent upper limit.</p><p>Read replication involves adding read-only copies of the database to other servers. However, this is typically limited to five replicas in total, which can only be used for read operations. This can cause issues with applications that are either write-heavy, or write and read regularly for the database, since it’s common for replicas to lag behind the write master. Multi-master replication support has been added to MySQL, but its implementation is more limited than the functionality available in MongoDB.</p><h2>MongoDB vs MySQL Performance</h2><p>Assessing the performance of two completely different database systems is very difficult, since both management systems approach the task for data storage and retrieval in completely different ways. While it’s possible to directly compare two SQL databases with a set of standard SQL benchmarks, achieving the same across non-relational and relational databases is much more difficult and subjective.</p><p>For example: MySQL is optimized for high performance joins across multiple tables that have been appropriately indexed. In MongoDB, joins are supported with the&nbsp;$<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">lookup</a>&nbsp;operation, but they are less needed due to the way MongoDB documents tend to be used; they follow a hierarchical data model and keep most of the data in one document, therefore eliminating the need for joins across multiple documents.</p><p>MongoDB is also optimized for write performance, and features a specific&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertMany/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">insertMany()</a>&nbsp;API for rapidly inserting data, prioritizing speed over transaction safety wherein MySQL data needs to be inserted row by row.</p><p>Observing some of the high-level query behaviors of the two systems, we can see that MySQL is faster at selecting a large number of records, while MongoDB is significantly faster at inserting or updating a large number of records.</p><h2>MongoDB vs MySQL Flexibility</h2><p>This is an easy one, and a hands down win for MongoDB. The schemaless design of MongoDB documents makes it extremely easy to build and enhance applications over time, without needing to run complex and expensive schema migration processes as you would with a relational database.</p><p>With MongoDB, there are more dynamic options for updating the schema of a collection, such as creating new fields based on an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.update/#update-method-agg-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">aggregation pipeline</a>&nbsp;or updating nested array fields. This benefit is particularly important as databases grow in size. In contrast, larger MySQL databases are slower to migrate schemas and stored procedures that can be dependent on the updated schemas. MongoDB’s flexible design makes this much less of a concern.</p><p>It’s worth pointing out that both databases have a lot in common. Both are free to get started with, both are easy to install on Linux and Windows, and both have wide programming language support for popular languages like Java,&nbsp;node.js, and Python.</p><p>In addition, MongoDB offers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">MongoDB Atlas</a>, a managed cloud solution which is also forever free to use for exploratory purposes, while for a MySQL managed cloud version, you would need to have an account with one of the major public cloud providers and fall within their free tier terms in order to not pay.</p><h2>MongoDB vs MySQL Security</h2><p>MongoDB leverages the popular role-based access control model with a flexible set of permissions. Users are assigned to a role, and that role grants them specific permissions over data sets and database operations. All communication is encrypted with TLS, and it’s possible to write encrypted documents to MongoDB data collections using a master key which is never available to MongoDB, achieving encryption of data at rest.</p><p>MySQL supports the same encryption features as MongoDB; its authentication model is also similar. Users can be granted roles but also privileges, giving them permissions over particular database operations and against particular data sets.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we have talked about the main differences between MongoDB and MySQL, a schemaless non-relational database system and a relational database system, respectively. We have explained when it is better to use one over the other. We have discussed the scalability, performance, and user-friendliness for each system.

Using MongoDB removes the complex object-relational mapping (ORM) layer that translates objects in code to relational tables. MongoDB’s flexible data model also means that your database schema can evolve with business requirements. MySQL\'s rigid relational structure adds overhead to applications and slows developers down as they must adapt objects in code to a relational structure.</p><p>MongoDB can also be scaled within and across multiple distributed data centers, providing new levels of availability and scalability previously unachievable with relational databases like MySQL. As your deployments grow in terms of data volume and throughput, MongoDB scales easily with no downtime, and without changing your application. In contrast, achieving scale with MySQL often requires significant custom engineering work.</p><h2>Which query language does each database use?</h2><p>Both databases support a rich query language.</p><p>MySQL, like many relational databases, uses structured query language (SQL) for access.</p><p>MongoDB uses the MongoDB Query Language (MQL), designed for easy use by developers. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">documentation</a>&nbsp;compares MQL and SQL syntax for common database operations.</p><h2>Is MongoDB faster than MySQL?</h2><p>Database performance can vary widely depending on a number of factors - database design, application query patterns and load on the database being just a few. Since MongoDB\'s document model stores related data together, it is often faster to retrieve a single document from MongoDB than to JOIN data across multiple tables in MySQL.</p><p>Many customers have evaluated and selected MongoDB over MySQL, both because of better performance at scale and for radical improvements to developer productivity.</p><h2>Does MySQL support JSON documents?</h2><p>For the reasons discussed above, MySQL and other relational databases have added support for JSON. However, simply adding a JSON data type does not bring the developer productivity benefits of a document database to MySQL. Why? Because&nbsp;<em>MySQL’s approach can detract from developer productivity</em>, rather than improve it. Consider the following:</p><ul><li>Proprietary Extensions to SQL:&nbsp;Querying and manipulating the contents of a JSON document requires the use of separate MySQL-specific SQL functions to access values, which will not be familiar to most developers. In addition, they are not supported or recognized by 3rd party SQL tools, such as BI platforms, data warehouse connectors, ETL and ESB pipelines, and more.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>How is MongoDB different:</em>&nbsp;The MongoDB API is widely understood, and adopted by industry standard tools and connectors. Several mega-vendor database companies have even adopted the MongoDB API themselves.</li><li>Legacy Relational Overhead:&nbsp;Even with JSON support, MySQL users are still tied to multiple layers of SQL/relational functionality to interact with JSON data – low level JDBC/ODBC drivers and Object Relational Mappers (ORMs). These layers impose high learning overhead. ORMs are also generally recognized as hard to optimize for performance and query efficiency – even for experienced relational developers. In addition, query optimization statistics for JSON data are more limited than those maintained for regular relational data types.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>How is MongoDB different:</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">MongoDB drivers</a>&nbsp;are implemented in the methods and functions that are idiomatic and natural to the programming languages used by developers.</li><li>Complex Data Handling:&nbsp;When using JSON data, MySQL drivers do not have the capability to properly and precisely convert JSON into a useful native data type used by the application. This includes different types of numeric values (e.g. floating points, 64-bit integers, decimals) timestamps, and dates, or a Map or List in Java or a Dictionary or List in Python. Developers have to manually convert text-based JSON in their application, losing the ability to have fields that can take on multiple data types in different documents (polymorphism) and making the computation, sorting and comparison of values difficult and error-prone.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>How is MongoDB different:</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">Binary Encoded JSON (BSON)</a>&nbsp;used by MongoDB and its drivers supports advanced data types not supported by regular text-based JSON.</li><li>No Data Governance:&nbsp;MySQL offers no native mechanism to validate the schema of JSON inserted or updated in the database, so developers need to add either application or database-side functionality to apply governance controls against the data.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>How is MongoDB different:</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(19, 170, 82);\">Schema validation</a>, based on the JSON Schema IETF standard, allows developers and DBAs to define and enforce a prescribed schema structure for each MongoDB collection.</li><li>Schema Rigidity:&nbsp;MySQL users still need to define a schema for their regular relational data. If the schema is then modified to accommodate new application requirements, the table is locked for some operations until existing data is copied into the new schema, requiring applications to be quiesced during schema migration.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>How is MongoDB different:</em>&nbsp;Developers and DBAs can combine the flexibility of a fully dynamic schema with the governance controls needed for some applications across all data stored in the database, not just subsets of it.</li></ul><p><br></p>', '2022-03-13', 0);

To create a flex container, we set the value of the area\'s container\'s&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--code-color);\"><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display\" target=\"_blank\">display</a></code>&nbsp;property to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">inline-flex</code>. As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become&nbsp;flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way.</p><ul><li>Items display in a row (the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-direction</code>&nbsp;property\'s default is&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">row</code>).</li><li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li><li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li><li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li><li>The&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--code-color);\"><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis\" target=\"_blank\">flex-basis</a></code>&nbsp;property is set to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">auto</code>.</li><li>The&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--code-color);\"><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap\" target=\"_blank\">flex-wrap</a></code>&nbsp;property is set to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">nowrap</code>.</li></ul><p>The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.</p><p>You can see in the live example below how this looks. Try editing the items or adding additional items in order to test the initial behavior of flexbox.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/flexbox/basics/the-flex-container.html\" height=\"480\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><p><br></p><h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#changing_flex-direction\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary);\">Changing flex-direction</a></h3><p>Adding the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--code-color);\"><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction\" target=\"_blank\">flex-direction</a></code>&nbsp;property to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items display.

What we are doing when we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.</p><p>If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don\'t change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the last item.</p><p><img src=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics7.png\" alt=\"This flex container has available space after laying out the items.\" height=\"198\" width=\"528\"></p><p>If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between the items. This is what the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex</code>&nbsp;properties that we apply to the items themselves, will do.</p><h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#the_flex-basis_property\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary);\">The flex-basis property</a></h3><p>The&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>&nbsp;is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">auto</code>&nbsp;— in this case the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above, all of the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>.</p><p>If the items don\'t have a size then the content\'s size is used as the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">display: flex</code>&nbsp;on the parent to create flex items, the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.</p><p><br></p><h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#the_flex-grow_property\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary);\">The flex-grow property</a></h3><p>With the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>&nbsp;property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow along the main axis from their&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>. This will cause the item to stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or a proportion of the available space if other items are allowed to grow too.</p><p>If we gave all of our items in the example above a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>&nbsp;value of 1 then the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.</p><p>The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first item a&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>&nbsp;value of 2, and the other items a value of 1 each, 2 parts of the available space will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).</p><h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#the_flex-shrink_property\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary);\">The flex-shrink property</a></h3><p>Where the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>&nbsp;property deals with adding space in the main axis, the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>&nbsp;property controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to lay out our items, and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>&nbsp;is set to a positive integer, then the item can become smaller than the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>. As with&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>, different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>&nbsp;will shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.</p><p>The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that flex-shrink has the potential to appear less consistent than flex-grow in behavior. We\'ll therefore take a more detailed look at how this algorithm works in the article&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Controlling_Ratios_of_Flex_Items_Along_the_Main_Ax\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--text-link);\">Controlling Ratios of items along the main axis</a>.</p><p>Note:&nbsp;These values for&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>&nbsp;are proportions. Typically if we had all of our items set to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex: 1 1 200px</code>&nbsp;and then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex: 2 1 200px</code>. However you could also use&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex: 10 1 200px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex: 20 1 200px</code>&nbsp;if you wanted.</p><h3><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#shorthand_values_for_the_flex_properties\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--text-primary);\">Shorthand values for the flex properties</a></h3><p>You will very rarely see the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>,&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>, and&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>&nbsp;properties used individually; instead they are combined into the&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--code-color);\"><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex\" target=\"_blank\">flex</a></code>&nbsp;shorthand.

Giving this a positive value means the item can grow. The second is&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>&nbsp;— with a positive value the items can shrink, but only if their total values overflow the main axis. The final value is&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>; this is the value the items are using as their base value to grow and shrink from.</p><iframe class=\"ql-video\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/flexbox/basics/flex-properties.html\" height=\"510\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><p>There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases.

In this case the value of&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-grow</code>&nbsp;is 0, so items will not grow larger than their&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-basis</code>&nbsp;size. The value of&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-shrink</code>&nbsp;is 1, so items can shrink if they need to rather than overflowing.

The initial value is&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-start</code>&nbsp;which will line the items up at the start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">flex-end</code>&nbsp;to line them up at the end, or&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">center</code>&nbsp;to line them up in the centre.</p><p>You can also use the value&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">space-between</code>&nbsp;to take all the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right and left of each item use the value&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">space-around</code>. With&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">space-around</code>, items have a half-size space on either end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the value&nbsp;<code style=\"color: var(--text-secondary);\">space-evenly</code>.
